### Selecting pattern for Table Storage Partition Key
Partition key for Azure table storage is selected to contain the log day in format YYYYMMDD
I expect/assume that most requests for retrieving the logs using from and to dates, 
will not have big day gaps. In such case selected Partition key pattern is optimal.
Depending on what ranges are mostly used, partition key should be set (e.g. if ranges are in several monthes,
and we have enough history length, then use monthes instead of days).

### Timezone issues
All dates including request parameters should be and are set in UTC timezone, 
so that there is no issues with Timezone mismatch between client and server.

### Response Pagination
In case we expect bigger sets of logs when requestion the list of logs, 
it makes sense to implement response pagination (that was not implemented)

### Services lifetime
When dealing with Azure Table Storage and Blob Storage clients in an Azure Function 
it's important to consider the best lifetime for these clients to ensure efficient resource utilization and optimal performance.
The recommended practice is to use singleton lifetime for these clients.
Even if the selected hosting plan, will prevent the long use of function instance, there are still benefits from using singleton.
Connection Pooling and Reuse: Both Azure Table and Blob Storage clients are designed to be reused and are thread-safe. 
Performance Optimization: Reusing clients across function invocations reduces latency associated with setting up new connections. 
Resource Management: Singleton instances ensure that the number of connections remains manageable, as new connections are not created with each function execution. 

### Further improvements
To improve the code and responses from GET API endpoints, 
I would think of using Result pattern on services. In cases when expected error happens in services e.g. ILogRepository did not found any requested item, 
we could return predefined Error. Based on that predefined Error we could return 404 http status code in response.
Model validation and global exception handlers would also improve response from get endpoints.
